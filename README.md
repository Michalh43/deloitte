Exercise 1: Chatter and Public Group Synchronization
Whenever a member is added to or removed from a Chatter group, this solution synchronizes that change with a public group of the same name.

Implementation Details
Trigger and Apex Class: Listens for member changes in Chatter groups and updates corresponding public groups.
Additions: Adds users to a public group matching the Chatter group name.
Removals: Removes users from the public group if they are removed from the Chatter group.
Group Creation: Automatically creates a public group if none exists for a new Chatter group.
Error Handling: Includes error handling for scenarios where groups or members cannot be updated.
Platform Events (Bonus): Publishes platform events for synchronization, enabling future integration with other systems if needed.


Exercise 2: Digital Voting System (Party Choice Page)
A digital voting interface allows users to select a party or blank vote. The system saves votes to the Salesforce database.

Party: Represents a political party.
Fields: Party Name, Description, Party Code, Leader Name.
Choice: Represents a citizen's vote.
